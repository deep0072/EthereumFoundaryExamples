# RANDOM RAFFLE SMART CONTRACTS

## About

this code is to create a random smart contract lottery. Decentralization will be at peak in this project. no biased selection

## what we want to do

1.Users can enter by paying for a ticket
2.after x period of time . the lottery will automatically draw a winner and fee collected as entry fee will be give to the winner. all will be done programmetically.
3. we use chainLink VRF and chainLink Automation
    1. chainLink VRF ==> for randomness
    2. chainLink Automation ==> time based trigger (time stamp)
